The text does not assume extensive background in linguistics, psychology or cognitive science, and includes all major extensions of the field. The collaborative authorship of eminent psycholinguists Berko Gleason and Bernstein Ratner assures the best possible coverage of these diverse topics. Features: * Chapter 2 has updated popular coverage of brain imaging and language processing. * Chapters 6 and 7 illustrate the dynamics of understanding language in context and the process of generating sentences. * The instructor's manual includes exercises, instructional activities, and handouts which demonstrate important material in the text. * The accompanying audio stimulus tape provides examples of difficult concepts such as speech intelligibility, categorical perception, click location and memory for words and sentences to encourage class participation. New to this edition: * Basic linguistic theory and terminology is covered more in detail and the research is thoroughly updated. * Chapter 6, Sentences Combined: Text and Discourse addresses a wider range of discourse processing, including mental models, text representation and memory, and connecting sentences in discourse. * Something to Think About questions stimulate students' critical thinking. * Each chapter contains mini-experiments designed to support students' grasp of material covered in the chapter.</p></div><!-- End description for Psycholinguistics --><span class="asin">0155041061</span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumCDBA0CBF-D5CC-41B0-B68F-934439729619"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('CDBA0CBF-D5CC-41B0-B68F-934439729619');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/CDBA0CBF-D5CC-41B0-B68F-934439729619-256.png" width="166" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/3150000017?tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Faust - Der Tragödie erster Teil</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Johann%20Wolfgang%20Goethe&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Johann Wolfgang Goethe  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>All books are shipped from Austria!</p></div><!-- End description for Faust - Der Tragödie erster Teil --><span class="asin">3150000017</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium87F94383-91BF-4AC1-A3B0-595DD431D685"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('87F94383-91BF-4AC1-A3B0-595DD431D685');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/87F94383-91BF-4AC1-A3B0-595DD431D685-256.png" width="256" height="225"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0141800968?tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Lord of the Flies</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=William%20Golding&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">William Golding  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>This is the compelling story about a group of very ordinary small boys marooned on a coral island.

The new Halliday/Resnick/Walker 7e eGrade Plus program provides the value added support that instructors and students want and need. Powered by Wiley's EduGen system, this site includes a vast array of high quality content including: Homework Management: an assignment tool allows instructors to create student homework and quizzes, using dynamic versions of end of chapter problems from Fundamentals of Physics or their own dynamic questions; instructors may also assign readings, activities, and other work for students to complete; and a gradebook automatically grades and records student assignments. This not only saves time, but also provides students with immediate feedback on their work. Each student can view his or her results from past assignments at any time. An Administration tool allows instructors to manage their class rosters on line. A Prepare and Present tool contains a variety of the Wiley provided resources (including all the book illustrations, Java applets, and digitized video) to help make preparation time more efficient. This content may easily be adapted, customized, and supplemented by instructors to meet the needs of each course. Self Assessment: A Study and Practice area links directly to the multimedia version of "Fundamental of Physics", allowing students to review the text while they study and complete homework assignments. In addition to the complete on line text, students can also access the Student Solutions Manual, the Student Study Guide, interactive simulations, and the Interactive LearningWare Program. The Interactive LearningWare leads the student step by step through solutions to 200 of the end of chapter problems from the text. And there's lots more!
