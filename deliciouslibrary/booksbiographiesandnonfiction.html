A Short History of Nearly Everything is his quest to find out everything that has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization - how we got from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. Bill Bryson's challenge is to take subjects that normally bore the pants off most of us, like geology, chemistry and particle physics, and see if there isn't some way to render them comprehensible to people who have never thought they could be interested in science. It's not so much about what we know, as about how we know what we know. How do we know what is in the centre of the Earth, or what a black hole is, or where the continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure these things out? On his travels through time and space, he encounters a splendid collection of astonishingly eccentric, competitive, obsessive and foolish scientists, like the painfully shy Henry Cavendish who worked out many conundrums like how much the Earth weighed, but never bothered to tell anybody about many of his findings. In the company of such extraordinary people, Bill Bryson takes us with him on the ultimate eye-opening journey, and reveals the world in a way most of us have never seen it before.</p></div><!-- End description for Short History of Nearly Everything --><span class="asin">0552997048</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium0FD4B183-86DD-487F-B582-08AC128CDA22"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('0FD4B183-86DD-487F-B582-08AC128CDA22');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/0FD4B183-86DD-487F-B582-08AC128CDA22-256.png" width="172" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0006544894?tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Tao of Physics</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Fritjof%20Capra&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Fritjof Capra  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The universe: an eternal cosmic dance of subatomic particles of relationships at once paradoxical, yet somehow unified.<br><br>Mystics explore our universe through meditation.

First he earned his freedom and then he won the presidency in the nation’s first free election in 1994. But he knew that South Africa was still dangerously divided by almost fifty years of apartheid. If he couldn’t unite his country in a visceral, emotional way—and fast—it would collapse into chaos. He would need all the charisma and strategic acumen he had honed during half a century of activism, and he’d need a cause all South Africans could share. Mandela picked one of the more farfetched causes imaginable—the national rugby team, the Springboks, who would host the sport’s World Cup in 1995.<br><br>Against the giants of the sport, the Springboks’ chances of victory were remote. But their chances of capturing the hearts of most South Africans seemed remoter still, as they had long been the embodiment of white supremacist rule. During apartheid, the all-white Springboks and their fans had belted out racist fight songs, and blacks would come to Springbok matches to cheer for whatever team was playing against them. Yet Mandela believed that the Springboks could embody—and engage—the new South Africa. And the Springboks themselves embraced the scheme. Soon South African TV would carry images of the team singing “Nkosi Sikelele Afrika,” the longtime anthem of black resistance to apartheid.<br><br>As their surprising string of victories lengthened, their home-field advantage grew exponentially. South Africans of every color and political stripe found themselves falling for the team. When the Springboks took to the field for the championship match against New Zealand’s heavily favored squad, Mandela sat in his presidential box wearing a Springbok jersey while sixty-two-thousand fans, mostly white, chanted “Nelson! Nelson!” Millions more gathered around their TV sets, whether in dusty black townships or leafy white suburbs, to urge their team toward victory. The Springboks won a nail-biter that day, defying the oddsmakers and capping Mandela’s miraculous ten-year-long effort to bring forty-three million South Africans together in an enduring bond.<br><br>John Carlin, a former South Africa bureau chief for the London Independent, offers a singular portrait of the greatest statesman of our time in action, blending the volatile cocktail of race, sport, and politics to intoxicating effect. He draws on extensive interviews with Mandela, Desmond Tutu, and dozens of other South Africans caught up in Mandela’s momentous campaign, and the Springboks’ unlikely triumph. As he makes stirringly clear, their championship transcended the mere thrill of victory to erase ancient hatreds and make a nation whole.</p></div><!-- End description for Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation --><span class="asin">1594201749</span></div></td><td><div class="medium" id="medium60998B09-4132-423D-B11E-5A013AAB1AF2"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('60998B09-4132-423D-B11E-5A013AAB1AF2');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/60998B09-4132-423D-B11E-5A013AAB1AF2-256.png" width="165" height="256"></div><a href="" class="title">Memoirs of a Fighting Captain</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Admiral%20Lord%20Cochrane&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Admiral Lord Cochrane  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p></p></div><!-- End description for Memoirs of a Fighting Captain --><span class="asin"></span></div><div class="medium" id="mediumE43774B3-0387-4119-83E1-E3671C7FCE02"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('E43774B3-0387-4119-83E1-E3671C7FCE02');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/E43774B3-0387-4119-83E1-E3671C7FCE02-256.png" width="189" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1843092085?tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Practical Woodworker: A Comprehensive Step-by-Step Course in Working with Wood</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Stephen%20Corbett&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Stephen Corbett  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>This is the complete practical woodworking book - a definitive reference guide for the beginner and the accomplished woodworking enthusiast alike.

Fossils only made sense in a world old enough to form them, and in the seventeenth century, few people could imagine such a thing. Texts no less authoritative than the Old Testament laid out very clearly the timescale of Earth's past; in fact one Anglican archbishop went so far as to calculate the exact date of Creation...October 23, 4004, B.C.<br><br>A revolution was in the making, however, and it was started by the brilliant and enigmatic Nicholas Steno, the man whom Stephen Jay Gould called "the founder of geology." Steno explored beyond the pages of the Bible, looking directly at the clues left in the layers of the Earth. With his groundbreaking answer to the fossil question, Steno would not only confound the religious and scientific thinking of his own time, he would set the stage for the modern science that came after him. He would open the door to the concept of "deep time," which imagined a world with a history of millions or billions of years. And at the very moment his expansive new ideas began to unravel the Bible's authoritative claim as to the age of the Earth, Steno would enter the priesthood and rise to become a bishop, ultimately becoming venerated as a saint and beatified by the Catholic Church in 1988.<br><br>Combining a thrilling scientific investigation with world-altering history and the portrait of an extraordinary genius, The Seashell on the Mountaintop gives us new insight into the very old planet on which we live, revealing how we learned to read the story told to us by the Earth itself, written in rock and stone.</p></div><!-- End description for The Seashell on the Mountaintop: A Story of Science, Sainthood, and the Humble Genius Who Discovered a New History of the Earth --><span class="asin">B0002X7W9M</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium48A5E3A6-ACB5-4253-B46A-A739300E4C39"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('48A5E3A6-ACB5-4253-B46A-A739300E4C39');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/48A5E3A6-ACB5-4253-B46A-A739300E4C39-256.png" width="256" height="68"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0143003542?tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">A Fortunate Life</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=A.%20B.%20Facey&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">A.

It begins with a detailed description of Anton Mesmer's 1774 discovery and recounts the story of his life. The major alterations in Mesmer's theory made by a variety of early pioneers, including the supposed paranormal powers possessed by somnambulists, are then examined, with a fuller account of the tragedy of John Elliotson than has appeared elsewhere. James Braid's coining of the term "hypnotism" to replace "animal magnetism" introduces the modern era, and after an appreciation of Braid's work the dramatic demonstrations in Charcot's Clinic are described, with the subsequent exposure of his errors by Bernheim and others. The book concludes with an account of the therapeutic and experiment work of the 20th century and the practical ways in which hypnotism is being employed today.</p></div><!-- End description for Hypnotism: A History --><span class="asin">0140280405</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium31B5128F-0C1D-4AF9-BA98-45E8A43F72E6"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('31B5128F-0C1D-4AF9-BA98-45E8A43F72E6');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/31B5128F-0C1D-4AF9-BA98-45E8A43F72E6-256.png" width="256" height="45"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0207186901?tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">We of the Never Never The Little Black Princess</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Mrs%20Aeneas%20Gunn&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Mrs Aeneas Gunn  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p></p></div><!-- End description for We of the Never Never The Little Black Princess --><span class="asin">0207186901</span></div><div class="medium" id="medium747158ED-9D04-410A-BBA8-491C742B222A"><div class="cover" onclick="showZoomedCover('747158ED-9D04-410A-BBA8-491C742B222A');"><img class="coverimage" src="covers/747158ED-9D04-410A-BBA8-491C742B222A-256.png" width="169" height="256"></div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1861761384?tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">War, Ice &amp; Piracy: The Remarkable Career of a Victorian Sailor</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Dominic%20Harrod&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Dominic Harrod  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The era of the 'Pax Britannic' was anything but peaceful for many Royal Navy officers. But few saw as much active service as Samuel Gurney Cresswell, who contrived to fight in the Baltic campaign of the misnamed 'Crimean War' - the first time whole battle fleets maneuvered and fought under steam power - and to achieve fame as an Arctic explorer (he is credited with being the first to traverse the much sought-after North West Passage, as the result of a truly epic sledging trip form the trapped HMS Investigator in 1853). As his career advanced, he rose to sea-going command, and played his part in the imperial coercion of China, which included amphibious operations and the suppression of piracy in the South China Sea. Throughout his action-packed service, he always found time to keep journals and to correspond with his family. He was an acute observer of the closed world of the Victorian navy, as well as the exotic climes he was privileged to visit, and his lively first-hand accounts form the raw material for this book. Like many contemporary sailor he could also express his observations in competent drawings and watercolors, but Cresswell's skill was of a higher order: indeed, he was summoned to the Palace to present his Arctic sketches to Queen Victoria, and they were eventually issued as lithographs. However, most were never published and appear here for the first time. This book follows Cresswell's career through his own journals and letters.</p></div><!-- End description for War, Ice &amp; Piracy: The Remarkable Career of a Victorian Sailor --><span class="asin">1861761384</span></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><span class="arrow left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span class="pages"><span class="page">1</span> <a class="page" href="booksbiographiesandnonfiction-2.html">2</a> <a class="page" href="booksbiographiesandnonfiction-3.html">3</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="booksbiographiesandnonfiction-2.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
