Today, the sixteen square-rigged tall ships that make their home in Australian and New Zealand waters have vastly different backgrounds and are used for a wide variety of purposes. From replica ships like the Bounty and the Endeavor to modern purpose-built sail training vessels like the Spirit of New Zealand, each ship inspires generations of sailors with her unmatched combination of grace and power. Some, like the James Craig (completed in 1874) and the Alma Doepel (built in 1903) stand as testimony to the craftsmanship and durability of old shipbuilding methods. They are living history, offering an insight into a way of life that would otherwise be lost forever. It is intended that, through a combination of lavish photography and insightful text, this book will bring to each tall ship the recognition it deserves.</p></div><!-- End description for Tall Ships: The Sixteen Square Riggers of Australia and New Zealand --></div><div class="medium" id="medium5FA3C56A-EF56-4B5F-838D-3EB633A5DC59"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1593081375"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/5FA3C56A-EF56-4B5F-838D-3EB633A5DC59-256.png" width="169" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593081375?tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">The Last of the Mohicans</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=James%20Fenimore%20Cooper&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">James Fenimore Cooper  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>The Last of the Mohicans, by James Fenimore Cooper, is part of the Barnes &amp; Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

Fossils only made sense in a world old enough to form them, and in the seventeenth century, few people could imagine such a thing. Texts no less authoritative than the Old Testament laid out very clearly the timescale of Earth's past; in fact one Anglican archbishop went so far as to calculate the exact date of Creation...October 23, 4004, B.C.<br><br>A revolution was in the making, however, and it was started by the brilliant and enigmatic Nicholas Steno, the man whom Stephen Jay Gould called "the founder of geology." Steno explored beyond the pages of the Bible, looking directly at the clues left in the layers of the Earth. With his groundbreaking answer to the fossil question, Steno would not only confound the religious and scientific thinking of his own time, he would set the stage for the modern science that came after him. He would open the door to the concept of "deep time," which imagined a world with a history of millions or billions of years. And at the very moment his expansive new ideas began to unravel the Bible's authoritative claim as to the age of the Earth, Steno would enter the priesthood and rise to become a bishop, ultimately becoming venerated as a saint and beatified by the Catholic Church in 1988.<br><br>Combining a thrilling scientific investigation with world-altering history and the portrait of an extraordinary genius, The Seashell on the Mountaintop gives us new insight into the very old planet on which we live, revealing how we learned to read the story told to us by the Earth itself, written in rock and stone.</p></div><!-- End description for The Seashell on the Mountaintop: A Story of Science, Sainthood, and the Humble Genius Who Discovered a New History of the Earth --></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><a class="arrow left" href="books-8.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <span class="pages"><a class="page" href="books-7.html">7</a> <a class="page" href="books-8.html">8</a> <span class="page">9</span> <a class="page" href="books-10.html">10</a> <a class="page" href="books-11.html">11</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="books-10.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
