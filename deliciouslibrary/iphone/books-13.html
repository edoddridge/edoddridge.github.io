It is primarily intended for students whose research requires more than an introductory statistics course, but who may not have an extensive background in rigorous mathematics. It's also suitable for courses with students of varying mathematical abilities. Hamilton provides students with a practical, realistic, and graphical approach to regression analysis so that they are better prepared to solve real, sometimes messy problems. For students and professors who prefer a heavier mathematical emphasis, the author has included optional sections throughout the text where the formal, mathematical development of the material is explained in greater detail. REGRESSION WITH GRAPHICS is appropriate for use with any (or no) statistical computer package. However, Hamilton used STAT A in the development of the text due to its ease of application and sophisticated graphics capabilities. (STATA is available in a student package from Duxbury including a tutorial by the same author: Hamilton, STATISTICS WITH STAT A, 5.0, 1998; ISBN: 0-534-31874-6.)</p></div><!-- End description for Regression with Graphics: A Second Course in Applied Statistics --></div></td></tr></table></div><!-- End media --><hr style="margin-top: 6pt"><div class="navigation"><div class="crumbs"><a class="arrow left" href="books-12.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <span class="pages"><a class="page" href="books-11.html">11</a> <a class="page" href="books-12.html">12</a> <span class="page">13</span> <a class="page" href="books-14.html">14</a> <a class="page" href="books-15.html">15</a> </span><a class="arrow right" href="books-14.html">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
