It is Hartford, Connecticut, in the late 1940's, and a set of twins is separated at birth by a desperate nurse. Nat Cartwright goes home with his parents, a schoolteacher and an insurance salesman. But his twin brother is to begin his days as Fletcher Andrew Davenport, son of a wealthy CEO and his society wife. During the years that follow, the two brothers grow up unaware of each other's existence. Nat leaves college at the University of Connecticut to serve in Vietnam. Returning a war hero, he finishes school and goes on to become a successful bank executive. Fletcher, meanwhile, has graduated from Yale University and distinguishes himself as a criminal defense lawyer before he is elected a senator. As their lives unfold, both men are confronted with tragedy and betrayal, loss and hardship, all the time overcoming life's obstacles to become the men they are destined to be. In the tradition of Jeffrey Archer's most popular books, SONS OF FORTUNE is as much a chronicle of a nation in transition as it is the story of the making of these two men - and how, eventually, they come to find each other...</p></div><!-- End description for Sons of Fortune --></div><div class="medium" id="medium7125B6D2-971F-432A-87FB-0521D1DE845B"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/7125B6D2-971F-432A-87FB-0521D1DE845B-256.png" width="165" height="256"></a><a href="" class="title">Let's Go Camping</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Girl%20Guides%20Association%20%28NSW%29&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Girl Guides Association (NSW)  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p></p></div><!-- End description for Let&apos;s Go Camping --></div><div class="medium" id="medium28D3F0D7-C61A-4CA8-ACF8-1176CA54D0D2"><a class="cover" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0340824441"><img class="coverimage" src="../covers/28D3F0D7-C61A-4CA8-ACF8-1176CA54D0D2-256.png" width="162" height="256"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0340824441?tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="title">Mammoth Hunters</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Jean%20M%20Auel&amp;tag=deliciousmons-20&amp;linkCode=xm2" class="creator">Jean M Auel  </a><div class="rating"></div><div class="buttons"><img src="../images/moredetails-close.png" alt="More Details" class="details_button" onclick="clickMediumDetailsButton(this);"></div><div class="description"><p>Leaving the valley of horses with Jondalar, the handsome man she has nursed back to health and come to love, Ayla embarks on a journey that will lead her to the Mamutoi; the Mammoth Hunters.

She is delighted when she meets Zelandoni, the spiritual leader of her people, a fellow healer with whom she can share her medicinal skills. After the rigours and dangers that have characterised her extraordinary life, Ayla yearns for peace and tranquillity; to be Jondalar's mate and to have children.
